2 ideas to be connected


My idea is to create a line of communication to deal with the water shortage in California. Maybe a system be implemented where the amount of water necessary to maintain a homeowner's lawn be communicated to the city's water management system. 

I would love for hospital's and Health Insurance database's to have the ability communicate with each other in real-time, streamlining the billing/invoicing for the customer!
